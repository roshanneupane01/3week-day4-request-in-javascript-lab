Week 3 Day 4 Request in Javascript Lab

In this lab, I've created a JavaScript script that interacts with a web application to perform various HTTP requests to a local server. The lab focuses on using Axios, a JavaScript HTTP client, to send GET and POST requests to fetch and display character data. The script includes functions to fetch all characters, fetch a specific character by its ID, fetch characters older than a certain age, and create new character cards. These actions are triggered by event listeners attached to buttons and forms on the web page. The lab demonstrates how to make asynchronous requests and handle server responses to dynamically update the web page with character information.
